# Concurrent-File-Processing-System

# Problem Statement:

Our project addresses the challenge of concurrent file processing, crucial in various applications like log analysis, data transformation, and real-time processing. The primary goal is to efficiently process multiple files simultaneously while ensuring thread safety, optimal resource usage, and data integrity. This challenge becomes particularly pronounced in scenarios like log analysis, where logs from different servers need to be parsed, analyzed, and transformed concurrently.

The POPL angle in this problem lies in the concurrent file processing aspect. Rust and C++ both adhere to principles that address issues related to concurrent programming, such as data races, memory safety, and thread synchronization. The use of Rust and C++ enables us to leverage language features that contribute to the safety and correctness of concurrent code.

While concurrent file processing is a well-explored area, existing solutions might not always address the specific requirements of our project. Traditional concurrent programming languages like Java and C++ require explicit synchronization mechanisms, making them prone to issues like data races and deadlocks. Rust, with its ownership and borrowing system, provides a unique approach to prevent these issues, ensuring memory safety without sacrificing performance.

Our project combines the strengths of Rust and C++. Rust's ownership model enhances safety and concurrency, while C++ provides low-level control and flexibility.
Rust's ownership and borrowing system ensures memory safety and prevents data races, allowing for efficient concurrent file processing without sacrificing safety.
The use of asynchronous socket communication in C++ enhances the efficiency of client-server interactions, enabling the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
The adoption of the nlohmann/json library in C++ facilitates robust JSON parsing, ensuring a reliable mechanism for processing JSON-formatted files.
Our solution considers IPv6 support for enhanced network compatibility, providing a modern and versatile communication infrastructure.
